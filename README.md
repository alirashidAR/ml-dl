# ML-DL

ðŸš€ **ML-DL** is a collection of my implementations of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, as well as reproductions of research papers. The goal of this project is to build a deep understanding by implementing techniques from scratch, making it a valuable resource for learning and experimenting with various approaches.

This repository will include:
- Classic ML algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, SVMs) implemented from scratch.
- Deep learning architectures (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, Transformers) built from the ground up.
- Reproductions of algorithms and experiments from research papers, with code implementations and results.
